Rajat Kumar Senapati


========================

B.Tech, Electrical Engineering


----------------------------------

I am currently an _**Engineer**_, struggling with a desire to be a _Civil Servant_ and, my mother's hope of being employed altogether.  
I love to listen retro songs and look into the extravagent beauty of mother nature.  
Peace out!!
